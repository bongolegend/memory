# Requirements

This first version of the product should be really simple. I will just allow the user to input journal entries with text, and I will store those entries in a document db. The user will be able to browse past entries.

The idea is to offer the most basic value add, which is a digital journal. Once that data is captured, we can add features to interact with it.

1. user can input journal entries with text. 
2. user can browse old journal entries.

# Product Roadmap
The vision is to allow users to engage with past journal entries intelligently.
